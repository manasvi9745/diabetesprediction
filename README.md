# Diabetes Prediction using Hybrid Models 🧠💉

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using a combination of hybrid machine learning models. Multiple hybrid strategies were applied and compared to identify the most accurate approach for early diabetes detection.

## 💡 Project Overview

In this study, various hybrid classification models were used on a diabetes dataset to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes or not. The objective was to test different model combinations and conclude which performs the best.

### 🔍 Hybrid Models Implemented:

1. **SVM + KNN Hybrid**  
2. **Naive Bayes + KNN Hybrid**  
3. **Decision Tree + KNN Hybrid**  
4. **Random Forest + KNN Hybrid**  
5. **Decision Tree + Logistic Regression Hybrid** (💎 *Best Performer*)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib (for optional visualizations)

## 🏆 Key Findings

The **Decision Tree + Logistic Regression Hybrid Model** achieved the highest prediction accuracy compared to other hybrid approaches. This proves that the combination of tree-based feature separation and logistic regression's probabilistic boundaries can handle diabetes prediction tasks more effectively.
